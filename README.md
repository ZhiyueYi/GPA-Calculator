# React GPA Calculator

React GPA Calculator, as the name suggests, is a simple GPA calculator built with React. It is a pure front-end application with no back-end at all. All the calculations are done in your browser. Your data would be upload to NOWHERE.

Simply host the application on your local to get your GPA calculated!
